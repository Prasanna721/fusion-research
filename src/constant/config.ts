It was observed that the initial morphology and stability of Zn deposition significantly influence dendrite growth during the plating/stripping process. The study identified that the presence of a dense and stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial in controlling dendrite growth. Without a protective SEI, the uneven deposition leads to the formation of whisker-like and moss-like dendrites.\n\nThe use of additives such as LiCl in electrolytes was seen to facilitate the formation of a LiS2S2O7-based SEI film, effectively inhibiting the formation of ZnO and by-products like zinc sulfate hydroxide hydrate (ZSH) that exacerbate dendrite growth. Additionally, the 12-C-4 additive was confirmed to enhance Zn2+ ion deposition uniformity, resulting in a dense Zn layer and improved cycling stability. These findings suggest that electrolytes modified with specific additives can significantly extend the lifespan of Zn-ion batteries by mitigating dendrite growth and enhancing electrode stability [1][2].\n\n### Sources\n[1] Unraveling chemical origins of dendrite formation in zinc-ion batteries: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52651-5  \n[2] New Study Reveals Mechanisms to Prevent Zinc Dendrite Formation in Batteries: https://battery-tech.net/battery-markets-news/new-study-reveals-mechanisms-to-prevent-zinc-dendrite-formation-in-batteries/',

              '## Impact of LiCl on Zn Dendrite Inhibition and Cycling Performance\n\nThe inclusion of lithium chloride (LiCl) as an electrolyte additive markedly enhances the performance of zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) by mitigating zinc dendrite formation. Experimental findings demonstrate that LiCl facilitates the formation of a stable and dense solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, primarily composed of LiS2S2O7, on the zinc anode surface. This SEI film effectively reduces the generation of detrimental by-products such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc sulfate hydroxide hydrate (ZSH) during zinc plating and stripping cycles [1].\n\nAs a result, the addition of LiCl significantly improves the cycling stability of ZIBs. Cells with this additive exhibit prolonged cycle life, lasting up to 138 hours at a current density of 1 mA/cm² with a stable overpotential [2]. This contrasts sharply with the performance of ZIBs without LiCl, which show considerably less stability due to the uncontrolled growth of zinc dendrites and rapid degradation of the zinc anode surface.\n\nThe strategic deployment of LiCl as an electrolyte additive emerges as an effective approach in advancing ZIB performance by curtailing dendrite growth and enhancing the long-term stability and safety of the battery [1][2].\n\n### Sources\n[1] Unraveling chemical origins of dendrite formation in zinc-ion batteries: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52651-5  \n[2] Alleviation of Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes via Electrolyte: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02371',

Furthermore, the technique’s inability to provide dynamic, real-world operational conditions combined with the potential artifacts introduced during beam interaction with Zn surfaces remains a challenge [4].

Zinc dendrites can cause significant capacity degradation and pose risks of short-circuiting. Advanced techniques like in situ/operando X-ray spectroscopy and imaging provide invaluable insights into the mechanisms behind dendrite growth, revealing the chemical changes and interactions at the electrode interface during operation. Such knowledge is crucial for developing strategies to inhibit dendrite formation, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficiency of next-generation zinc-ion batteries.\n\n## Key Findings from the Synchrotron-Based In Situ STXM Study\n\nThe in situ synchrotron-based STXM study provided critical insights into the mechanisms of zinc (Zn) dendrite formation in zinc-ion batteries. It was observed that the initial morphology and stability of Zn deposition significantly influence dendrite growth during the plating/stripping process. The study identified that the presence of a dense and stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial in controlling dendrite growth. Without a protective SEI, the uneven deposition leads to the formation of whisker-like and moss-like dendrites.\n\nThe use of additives such as LiCl in electrolytes was seen to facilitate the formation of a LiS2S2O7-based SEI film, effectively inhibiting the formation of ZnO and by-products like zinc sulfate hydroxide hydrate (ZSH) that exacerbate dendrite growth. Additionally, the 12-C-4 additive was confirmed to enhance Zn2+ ion deposition uniformity, resulting in a dense Zn layer and improved cycling stability. These findings suggest that electrolytes modified with specific additives can significantly extend the lifespan of Zn-ion batteries by mitigating dendrite growth and enhancing electrode stability [1][2].\n\n### Sources\n[1] Unraveling chemical origins of dendrite formation in zinc-ion batteries: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52651-5  \n[2] New Study Reveals Mechanisms to Prevent Zinc Dendrite Formation in Batteries: https://battery-tech.net/battery-markets-news/new-study-reveals-mechanisms-to-prevent-zinc-dendrite-formation-in-batteries/\n\n## Methodologies of In Situ/Operando X-ray Spectroscopy and Imaging\n\nIn situ and operando X-ray spectroscopy and imaging techniques are critical tools for observing zinc (Zn) dendrite growth in batteries, providing insights into structural and phase changes. Synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) offers high temporal and spatial resolution, enabling real-time monitoring of Zn dendrite formation and associated structural dynamics [1][2]. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) complements this by delivering detailed information on chemical composition and morphology [3]. Meanwhile, X-ray computed tomography (XCT) provides non-destructive 3D imaging to observe not only dendrite formation but also physical degradation over time, making it indispensable for understanding the impact of dendrites on battery performance [4].\n\nDespite their advantages, these methods have significant limitations. They are reliant on limited-access synchrotron facilities and necessitate specialized sample preparation and experimental setup, potentially affecting experimental throughput [5]. Additionally, the design of the cell must accommodate in situ imaging, often restricting the range of experimental conditions that can be explored.\n\nOverall, in situ/operando X-ray techniques are invaluable for uncovering the complex interactions within batteries, crucial for developing safer and more efficient energy storage solutions.\n\n### Sources\n[1] URL: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00331  \n[2] URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41427-018-0056-z  \n[3] URL: https://www.oaepublish.com/articles/cs.2023.46  \n[4] URL: https://www.azooptics.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2733  \n[5] URL: https://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/fal/fal11/fal11_p043-047.pdf  \n\n## Impact of LiCl on Zn Dendrite Inhibition and Cycling Performance\n\nThe inclusion of lithium chloride (LiCl) as an electrolyte additive markedly enhances the performance of zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) by mitigating zinc dendrite formation. Experimental findings demonstrate that LiCl facilitates the formation of a stable and dense solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, primarily composed of LiS2S2O7, on the zinc anode surface. This SEI film effectively reduces the generation of detrimental by-products such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc sulfate hydroxide hydrate (ZSH) during zinc plating and stripping cycles [1].\n\nAs a result, the addition of LiCl significantly improves the cycling stability of ZIBs. Cells with this additive exhibit prolonged cycle life, lasting up to 138 hours at a current density of 1 mA/cm² with a stable overpotential [2]. This contrasts sharply with the performance of ZIBs without LiCl, which show considerably less stability due to the uncontrolled growth of zinc dendrites and rapid degradation of the zinc anode surface.\n\nThe strategic deployment of LiCl as an electrolyte additive emerges as an effective approach in advancing ZIB performance by curtailing dendrite growth and enhancing the long-term stability and safety of the battery [1][2].\n\n### Sources\n[1] Unraveling chemical origins of dendrite formation in zinc-ion batteries: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52651-5  \n[2] Alleviation of Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes via Electrolyte: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02371\n\n## Limitations and Challenges in Studying Zn Dendrite Formation Using In Situ STXM\n\nIn situ scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) is a powerful tool for investigating the chemical nature and morphology of zinc (Zn) dendrites during battery operation. However, several limitations exist. One of the primary challenges is the high susceptibility of the Zn dendrite morphology and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) stability to environmental conditions during scanning. This sensitivity can lead to discrepancies in results if conditions are not meticulously controlled [1]. \n\nAnother major constraint is the spatial resolution limit of STXM, which although finely detailed, may not capture the complete intricacies of Zn dendrite structures at the atomic or nanometer scale [2]. There is also the issue of potential beam-induced modifications during analysis. High-energy X-ray beams used in STXM might alter the morphology of Zn during scanning, impeding accurate in situ observation [3]. Furthermore, the technique’s inability to provide dynamic, real-world operational conditions combined with the potential artifacts introduced during beam interaction with Zn surfaces remains a challenge [4]. Consequently, integrating complementary characterization techniques is often necessary for comprehensive understanding of Zn dendrite formation.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Source Title: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775320311356  \n[2] Source Title: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52651-5  \n[3] Source Title: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468606921000575  \n[4] Source Title: https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30522-1  \n\n## Conclusions and Future Research Directions\n\nThis report underscores the crucial role of electrolyte additives, such as LiCl and 12-C-4, in mitigating Zn dendrite formation in zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs).

Understanding the formation of zinc dendrites in zinc-ion batteries is pivotal for improving their performance, particularly in extending the life and safety of these batteries. Zinc dendrites can cause significant capacity degradation and pose risks of short-circuiting. Advanced techniques like in situ/operando X-ray spectroscopy and imaging provide invaluable insights into the mechanisms behind dendrite growth, revealing the chemical changes and interactions at the electrode interface during operation. Such knowledge is crucial for developing strategies to inhibit dendrite formation, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficiency of next-generation zinc-ion batteries.

## Key Findings from the Synchrotron-Based In Situ STXM Study

The in situ synchrotron-based STXM study provided critical insights into the mechanisms of zinc (Zn) dendrite formation in zinc-ion batteries. It was observed that the initial morphology and stability of Zn deposition significantly influence dendrite growth during the plating/stripping process. The study identified that the presence of a dense and stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial in controlling dendrite growth. Without a protective SEI, the uneven deposition leads to the formation of whisker-like and moss-like dendrites.

The use of additives such as LiCl in electrolytes was seen to facilitate the formation of a LiS2S2O7-based SEI film, effectively inhibiting the formation of ZnO and by-products like zinc sulfate hydroxide hydrate (ZSH) that exacerbate dendrite growth. Additionally, the 12-C-4 additive was confirmed to enhance Zn2+ ion deposition uniformity, resulting in a dense Zn layer and improved cycling stability. These findings suggest that electrolytes modified with specific additives can significantly extend the lifespan of Zn-ion batteries by mitigating dendrite growth and enhancing electrode stability [1][2].

## Methodologies of In Situ/Operando X-ray Spectroscopy and Imaging

In situ and operando X-ray spectroscopy and imaging techniques are critical tools for observing zinc (Zn) dendrite growth in batteries, providing insights into structural and phase changes. Synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) offers high temporal and spatial resolution, enabling real-time monitoring of Zn dendrite formation and associated structural dynamics [1][2]. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) complements this by delivering detailed information on chemical composition and morphology [3]. Meanwhile, X-ray computed tomography (XCT) provides non-destructive 3D imaging to observe not only dendrite formation but also physical degradation over time, making it indispensable for understanding the impact of dendrites on battery performance [4].

Despite their advantages, these methods have significant limitations. They are reliant on limited-access synchrotron facilities and necessitate specialized sample preparation and experimental setup, potentially affecting experimental throughput [5]. Additionally, the design of the cell must accommodate in situ imaging, often restricting the range of experimental conditions that can be explored.

Overall, in situ/operando X-ray techniques are invaluable for uncovering the complex interactions within batteries, crucial for developing safer and more efficient energy storage solutions.

## Impact of LiCl on Zn Dendrite Inhibition and Cycling Performance

The inclusion of lithium chloride (LiCl) as an electrolyte additive markedly enhances the performance of zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) by mitigating zinc dendrite formation. Experimental findings demonstrate that LiCl facilitates the formation of a stable and dense solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, primarily composed of LiS2S2O7, on the zinc anode surface. This SEI film effectively reduces the generation of detrimental by-products such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc sulfate hydroxide hydrate (ZSH) during zinc plating and stripping cycles [1].

As a result, the addition of LiCl significantly improves the cycling stability of ZIBs. Cells with this additive exhibit prolonged cycle life, lasting up to 138 hours at a current density of 1 mA/cm² with a stable overpotential [2]. This contrasts sharply with the performance of ZIBs without LiCl, which show considerably less stability due to the uncontrolled growth of zinc dendrites and rapid degradation of the zinc anode surface.

The strategic deployment of LiCl as an electrolyte additive emerges as an effective approach in advancing ZIB performance by curtailing dendrite growth and enhancing the long-term stability and safety of the battery [1][2].

## Limitations and Challenges in Studying Zn Dendrite Formation Using In Situ STXM

In situ scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) is a powerful tool for investigating the chemical nature and morphology of zinc (Zn) dendrites during battery operation. However, several limitations exist. One of the primary challenges is the high susceptibility of the Zn dendrite morphology and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) stability to environmental conditions during scanning. This sensitivity can lead to discrepancies in results if conditions are not meticulously controlled [1]. 

Another major constraint is the spatial resolution limit of STXM, which although finely detailed, may not capture the complete intricacies of Zn dendrite structures at the atomic or nanometer scale [2]. There is also the issue of potential beam-induced modifications during analysis. High-energy X-ray beams used in STXM might alter the morphology of Zn during scanning, impeding accurate in situ observation [3]. Furthermore, the technique’s inability to provide dynamic, real-world operational conditions combined with the potential artifacts introduced during beam interaction with Zn surfaces remains a challenge [4]. Consequently, integrating complementary characterization techniques is often necessary for comprehensive understanding of Zn dendrite formation.
